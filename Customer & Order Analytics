SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS total_orders

WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#2. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct c.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1;

#4. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#5. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#6. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON c.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND quantity > 2
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#7. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(c.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.customers c

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Fs
ON c.order_id = Fs.orderID

WHERE length(orderID) = 6

#12. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total? 
SELECT product, sum(quantity) AS count_product, sum(quantity*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
