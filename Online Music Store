#The project consists of analyzing sales data from an online music store. The queries focus on identifying potential customers, 
analyzing sales performance by country, agent and year, and providing information on tracks sold.

#1. Identify potential customers in Brazil.
SELECT c.CustomerId, c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS Name, c.Email, c.Phone, c.Address, c.City, c.State, c.PostalCode, c.Country
FROM chinook.invoices i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c 
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE i.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#2. Shows the list of countries, along with their total sales and the percentage of total sales they represent.
SELECT BillingCountry, ROUND((SUM(Total) / (SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices)) * 100, 1) AS Percentage
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry
ORDER BY Total DESC;

#3. Shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
SELECT e.LastName || ' ' || e.FirstName AS Name, i.InvoiceId,  i.InvoiceDate, i.CustomerId
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c ON i.Customerid = c.Customerid
JOIN chinook.employees e ON c.SupportRepid = e.employeeid
GROUP BY e.employeeid;

#4. Provides information on sales performance in 2009
SELECT SUM(Total) AS TotalSales, COUNT(*) AS InvoiceCount
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

#5. This query retrieves the track name, invoice ID, invoice date, and customer ID. The result is grouped by track name and invoice ID.
SELECT t.Name AS TrackName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.CustomerId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ii ON t.TrackId = ii.TrackId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON ii.InvoiceId = i.InvoiceId
GROUP BY t.Name, i.InvoiceId;

#6. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name, a.Title AS album_title, m.Name AS media_type, g.Name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a ON t.albumid = a.albumid
JOIN chinook.media_types m ON t.mediatypeid = m.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.genres g ON t.genreid = g.genreid;

#7. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS Name, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId;

#8. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009? 
SELECT s.FirstName || ' ' || s.LastName AS 'Name', ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees s
JOIN chinook.customers c ON s.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY s.EmployeeId
ORDER BY SUM(i.Total) DESC LIMIT 1;
